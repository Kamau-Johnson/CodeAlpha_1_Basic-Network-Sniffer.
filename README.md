# CODE ALPHA CYBER SECURITY

## Task 1: Basic Network Sniffer  
As part of my Cyber Security Internship at Code Alpha, I developed a Basic Network Sniffer in Python to capture and analyze network traffic. This project provided insights into data flow on a network and packet structure analysis, enhancing my understanding of network security.

## Key Highlights of the Project  
**Packet Capture** – Used Python and Scapy to monitor network traffic in real time.  
**Protocol Analysis** – Inspected TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets for security insights.  
**Traffic Filtering** – Implemented filtering to isolate specific packet types and analyze patterns.  
**Security Insights** – Identified potential anomalies and unauthorized network activities.

### Tools Used  
**Scapy** – Captured and analyzed network packets.  
**Wireshark** – Verified traffic and deep-dived into packet structure.  
**Socket Library** – Established raw socket connections for sniffing.

## Skills Developed  
**Network Packet Analysis** – Gained hands-on experience in decoding network packets.  
**Traffic Monitoring** – Captured and filtered data packets for deeper security analysis.  
**Network Security Awareness** – Understood the significance of encrypted vs. unencrypted traffic.  
**Python for Cybersecurity** – Strengthened programming skills in network security applications.

## Why This Project Matters  
With the growing number of cyber threats, understanding how network traffic flows is crucial for security monitoring and threat detection. This project helps:  
- Build foundational knowledge in network security and traffic analysis.  
- Develop hands-on experience with packet inspection and filtering.  
- Understand the importance of secure network communication.

## Conclusion  
The Basic Network Sniffer project provided practical exposure to network traffic analysis, enhancing my ability to detect anomalies and monitor data security. Proactively analyzing network traffic is key to strengthening cybersecurity and preventing potential threats.
